Problem 3-1
a) An AVL tree will work nicely, since they support sub-linear insertion, find-min and find-max
b) Insert takes O(log n) time for an AVL tree
c) Finding the minimum will take O(log n) since we just keep looking left from the root
d) Finding the maximum will take O(log n) since we just keep looking right from the root
e) COUNT(l,h) = RANK(h) - RANK(l) + 1
f)
g)
h)
i) You should store the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node
j) O(log n) extra bits per node
k) 1
l) 3
m) 6
n) 10

Problem 3-2
a) The intersects method is slowest
b)
c)
